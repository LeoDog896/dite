# dite

a little bit of a framework

NOTE: This is **not** a port of vite as the name suggests. Deno works
differently than node. Howwever, as dite also uses rollup for its backend, vite
plugin compatibility is a semi-goal.

Features:

- Deno (TypeScript first)

## routing

First, framework files in rotes
